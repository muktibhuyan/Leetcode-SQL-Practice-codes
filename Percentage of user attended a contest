Solution 1:
WITH total_users AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total
    FROM Users
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    R.contest_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(R.user_id) * 100.0 / T.total, 2) AS percentage
FROM Register R
CROSS JOIN total_users T
GROUP BY R.contest_id, T.total
ORDER BY percentage DESC, R.contest_id;



Solution 2 :
